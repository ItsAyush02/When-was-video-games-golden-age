# When-was-video-games-golden-age
In this project, I have analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I have searched for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I have explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.
